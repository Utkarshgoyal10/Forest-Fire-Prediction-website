Introduction
Forest fires are a natural disaster that can cause widespread destruction, leading to ecological imbalances and endangering lives. Predicting forest fires in advance enables authorities to take proactive measures to minimize damage and protect forests.

This project aims to build a forest fire prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model will analyze various environmental factors and historical fire data to predict the likelihood of a forest fire occurrence. By leveraging this predictive capability, the project aims to assist relevant stakeholders in making informed decisions and allocating resources efficiently.

Data
The dataset used for training and evaluation contains historical records of forest fires, including various environmental features and the corresponding fire occurrence labels. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, it can be obtained from [source link] (provide link to dataset source).
Please ensure that you have acquired the dataset and placed it in the appropriate directory before proceeding with the installation and usage steps.

Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

Usage
To use the forest fire prediction model, follow these steps:

Make sure you have completed the installation steps.
Prepare your dataset by following the instructions in the Data section.
Modify the configuration files (if necessary) to customize the model settings.
Run the prediction script using the command:
Provide the relevant input data when prompted by the script.
The model will generate a prediction indicating the likelihood of a forest fire occurrence based on the provided input.
Model Training
If you wish to train the model using your own dataset, please follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset and ensure it is in the appropriate format (e.g., CSV, JSON, etc.).
Modify the configuration files (if necessary) to adjust training parameters.
Monitor the training progress and evaluate the model's performance using the specified evaluation metrics.
After training, the model weights and relevant artifacts will be saved for future use.
Evaluation
The project includes evaluation scripts to assess the performance of the forest fire prediction model. To evaluate the model using your dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare your evaluation dataset, ensuring it is in the correct format.
Modify the evaluation configuration files (if necessary) to specify the evaluation parameters

The evaluation results will be displayed, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
